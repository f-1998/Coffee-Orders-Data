# Coffee Orders Data 

### Key Tasks Performed:

- Explored coffee dataset using Excel.
- Utilized advanced lookup methods: `XLOOKUP` and `INDEX MATCH`.
- Calculated total sales using a multiplication formula: `(quantity sold * unit price)`.
- Employed multiple `IF` functions for data categorization.
- Checked for duplicates to maintain data integrity.
- Converted the dataset into a structured table for easier management.
- Used `Pivot Tables` and `Pivot Charts` for deeper insights into sales trends.
- Incorporated `Timelines` and `Slicers` for enhanced data visualization.
- Updated `Pivot Table` data sources for relevance.
- Built a comprehensive dashboard presenting key metrics and visualizations.




### Structured Table Overview

The structured table is the backbone of the dashboard, comprising various columns that store critical data points. Key columns in the table include:

#### Order Details:
- **Order ID:** Unique identifier for each order placed.
- **Date:** The date when the order was placed, formatted for easy timeline analysis.
- **Product Details:** Information about the coffee sold, including type (roast), size, and unit price.

#### Customer Information:
- **Customer ID:** Unique identifier for each customer, used to link customer-specific data.
- **Customer Name:** Names of customers, retrieved using lookup formulas (e.g., `XLOOKUP`).
- **Country:** The country from which the order originated, aiding in the sales by country analysis.
- **Loyalty Card Status:** Indicates whether the customer holds a loyalty card, essential for tracking loyalty-driven sales.

#### Sales Data:
- **Quantity Sold:** The number of units sold in a particular order.
- **Unit Price:** The price of each unit sold.
- **Total Sales:** This is calculated by multiplying the quantity sold by the unit price (i.e., `Quantity Sold * Unit Price`). This column is vital for calculating the overall revenue.

#### Product Details:
- **Product Type:** Type of coffee (e.g., specific roast type).
- **Size:** Coffee size (in kg), useful for segmenting sales data by product variations.
- **Roast Type:** Whether the product is light, medium, or dark roast, providing an additional level of categorization for analysis.

By organizing the data into a structured table, the user can easily reference specific data points using formulas (like `INDEX MATCH` or `XLOOKUP`), which dynamically populate charts and pivot tables in the dashboard. This structure ensures flexibility and accuracy as data updates are easily reflected in the visualizations.

## Key Takeaways

### Strong Product Performance:
- Certain coffee types (e.g., specific roast types or sizes) generate significantly higher sales compared to others. By analyzing this data, it is possible to optimize the product mix and marketing strategies.
- The timeline chart provides insights into fluctuations in sales over time, revealing seasonal trends. For example, sales might spike during specific months, which could help with inventory planning.

### Geographical Insights:
- The sales by country chart highlights which regions are performing well and where there are opportunities for growth. For example, the United States and a few other countries may account for the bulk of sales, suggesting a strong market presence in those areas. Identifying underperforming regions can guide targeted marketing efforts.

### Customer Focus:
- The top five customers by sales reveal key relationships that the business should prioritize. Maintaining strong relationships with these high-value customers can have a disproportionate impact on revenue.
- Loyalty card data demonstrates the effectiveness of retention strategies. Customers with loyalty cards may contribute more to sales, suggesting that expanding loyalty programs could enhance customer lifetime value.

### Customization for User Engagement:
- The use of slicers and timelines provides an interactive experience, allowing users to drill down into specific metrics. This customization enhances the user experience and makes the dashboard more versatile for various stakeholders, such as sales teams or management.

### Actionable Data for Decision-Making:
- By identifying trends and top performers (e.g., coffee types, regions, customers), the dashboard provides actionable insights. Management can adjust inventory, optimize product offerings, or refine marketing tactics based on these insights.
